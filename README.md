<br>



### Commissioner Site Powers and Duty ###
The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams if necessary. The commissioner has a duty to uphold the integrity, competitive spirit, and enjoyment of the league, and will only ever use his abilites/powers to fulfill this duty. 
<br>
### Dispute Arbitration ###
The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. In situations where a league vote is put forth and the outcome is a tie the commissioner will always have the tiebreaking vote. When an issue arrises where a clear conflict of interest is apparant, the matter will be put to a league vote (the vote will exclude anyone with a conflict of interest).
<br>
### Rule Changes ###
In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called by the commissioner and receive a majority from league members (in a tie the commissioner has the tiebreaking vote). League members may submit potential rule/structure changes at any time to the commissioner for consideration. 
<br>
### Collusion ###
**Collusion will not be tolerated. A trade will be vetoed if there is evident collusion and the guilty teams will be removed from the league and forfeit any dues paid**

### Yearly Dues ###
