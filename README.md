## __Section I - League Overview__ ##

### League Structure ###
The European Superleague is a 12 team, single division, Dynasty League. Each team will represent a different European city/town. Teams will compete each season in a head to head, PPR scoring format in an attempt to finish with one of 6 playoff places, and will then do battle in a post season knockout playoff to be crowned Champions of Europe. 
<br>

## __Section II - League Governence__ ##

### League Commissioner ###

<br>



### Commissioner Site Powers and Duty ###
The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams if necessary. The commissioner has a duty to uphold the integrity, competitive spirit, and enjoyment of the league, and will only ever use his abilites/powers to fulfill this duty. If any team/owner threatens any of these fundamental aspects of the league, they can be removed or replaced.
<br>
### Dispute Arbitration ###
The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. In situations where a league vote is put forth and the outcome is a tie the commissioner will always have the tiebreaking vote. When an issue arrises where a clear conflict of interest is apparant, the matter will be put to a league vote (the vote will exclude anyone with a conflict of interest).
<br>
### Rule Changes ###
In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called by the commissioner and receive a majority from league members (in a tie the commissioner has the tiebreaking vote). League members may submit potential rule/structure changes at any time to the commissioner for consideration. Rule changes will always be voted on in the off season, prior to the rookie draft.
<br>
### Collusion ###
**Collusion (two or more owners conspiring to provide an unfair advantage to one or more teams) will not be tolerated, in any form. Examples of collusion include but are not limited to: throwing games, renting players (when a player is traded to another team with the understanding the player will be returned to the original team at a later date), dumping players (in an attempt to give another team a waiver advantage by giving them inside knowledge of player availability) or making unfair trades. Owners found guilty of collusion will be immediately removed from the league without refund.**
<br>
### Tanking/Throwing Games ###
**Intentional "tanking" or attempting to lose games for any reason is strictly prohibited. The rookie draft order is decided in such a way (see section viii - rookie draft) that tanking by setting sub optimal lineups is not beneficial, but to maintain the integrity and ensure the competitive fairness of the league, all teams must set their lineups properly, and in the "spirit of the game" every gameweek. This means that teams must have full starting rosters, and managers must not, in an attempt to influence results, select players who are either: a) obviously unlikely to play for any reason, or b) obviously unlikely to contribute significantly compared to players they leave on the bench. Sit/Start decisions are affected by many factors, and except for in extreme and obvious examples, will always be a matter for individual managers, but the commissioner reserves the right to make changes to a teams lineup in scenarios where they are obviously in breach of this rule.**
<br>
### Team Owner Responsibilities ###
-In a dynasty league, it is essential that all owners are active in some fashion all year round. Owners should respond to all trade offers in a timely manner, even if it is just to politely decline. Lineups should always be set, and owners should endeavour to respond to league communications as soon as possible. 
-Fantasy football is a game built around manager interaction, and banter/rivalries/trash talking is actively encouraged. It should however go without saying that hateful abuse of any kind will not be tolerated, bigots of any kind are not welcome in the ESL and will be removed. 
<br>
### Team Owner Leaving ###
If a teamâ€™s owner no longer wishes to continue to participate in the ESL, please contact the League Commissioner as soon as possible in order that they may arrange a replacement owner. If possible, this should be done at the conclusion of a season, before any off season activities commence, and well in advance of the rookie draft. Any owner leaving for any reason during a season will forfeit that seasons league fees, and any future league fees paid.
In the event of an owner leaving the league mid-season for any reason, the Commissioner will run the former owners team by inserting the players at each position with the highest projected total until the ownership is filled. No trades/waiver pick ups will be made. 
<br> 
### Owner Removal ###
If an owner is not adhering to proper ownership guidelines (setting rosters, not responding to league communications, behaving in an aggressive or intimidating manner etc.) then they are subject to possible removal by the commissioner. Any owner removed for such an offense will forfeit any league fees paid.
<br>

<br><br>

## __Section III - League Dues__ ##

### Entry Fee ###
- The Entry Fee for the league is $50 per team. This covers the 2021 season which starts on 10/09/21. In addition all managers must pay the dues for the second season (2022) at the same time as paying the entry fee. These fees must be paid 48 hours before the start up draft commences. 
- All entry fees will be handled by the Teamstake website. All credit/debit card transactions will be subject to a 4% fee, so owners will be charged this on top of their entry fees. 
### Yearly Dues ###

- After the first two years there is a yearly total of $50 that must be paid 2 weeks before the start of the yearly rookie draft.
- Dues must also be paid immediately for any year a team trades draft picks in. These fees will be due within 24 hours of the trade being completed. Failure to pay these dues will result in the trade being cancelled.

### Penalties ###
If a team does not pay their dues by the designated date they are not eligible to participate in the draft (startup or rookie) it will be up to the commissioners discretion on whether or not to replace them.

### Trades ###
- All trades will be processed on acceptance by all parties without a review period. All trades will be allowed unless obvious collusion takes place. If anyone has any concerns regarding collusion in trades, these should be raised with the commissioner. If the commissioner has serious suspicions about a trade, the validity of such a trade can be put to a league vote. Trades can be reversed by the commissioner if required as a result.

<br><br>

## __Section VIII - Rookie Draft__ ##

### Rookie Draft Order ###
- The draft order for the rookie draft will be determined based on the following:
- Picks 1-6 will be based on the maximum potential points scored by the bottom six teams according to sleeper in reverse order. So from the bottom six teams, the team with the lowest potential points scored in the regular season will receive pick 1.01, the team with the second lowest potential points the 1.02 and so on. This system tries to ensure the teams who need the most help from the rookie draft get it, without encouraging tanking
- Picks 7-12 will be assigned based on playoff finishing position of the top 6 teams. For example, Champion -1.12, Runner up -1.11, next four picks based on playoff seeding.

### Rookie Draft Settings ###
- There will be 4 rounds of the rookie draft.
- The rookie draft will take place shortly after completion of the NFL draft.
- The draft will follow a linear format just like the NFL draft (1.01 has 2.01, 3.01, 4.01 etc.)
- Each day the draft will last from 7AM to 11PM BST with each team having 8 hours per pick.
- Trading draft picks is allowed during the rookie draft
- If a team misses their pick the best available player based on Sleeper ADP will be autodrafted.
