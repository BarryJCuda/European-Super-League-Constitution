<br>



### Commissioner Site Powers and Duty ###
The commissioner has the ability to (in appropriate situations) edit lineups (either current or past), add/drop players, push/undo trades, and edit game scores. Additionally the commissioner can pause/resume the draft and set/remove draft picks for teams if necessary. The commissioner has a duty to uphold the integrity, competitive spirit, and enjoyment of the league, and will only ever use his abilites/powers to fulfill this duty. 
<br>
### Dispute Arbitration ###
The commissioner is the final authority on all league matters, excluding disputes with a clear conflict of interest. In situations where a league vote is put forth and the outcome is a tie the commissioner will always have the tiebreaking vote. When an issue arrises where a clear conflict of interest is apparant, the matter will be put to a league vote (the vote will exclude anyone with a conflict of interest).
<br>
### Rule Changes ###
In order to change an existing rule, add a new rule, or change a scoring setting, a vote must be called by the commissioner and receive a majority from league members (in a tie the commissioner has the tiebreaking vote). League members may submit potential rule/structure changes at any time to the commissioner for consideration. 
<br>
### Collusion ###
**Collusion will not be tolerated. A trade will be vetoed if there is evident collusion and the guilty teams will be removed from the league and forfeit any dues paid**

<br><br>

## __Section II - League Dues__ ##

### Entry Fee ###
- The Entry Fee for the league is $50 per team. This covers the 2021 season which starts on 10/09/21. In addition all managers must pay the dues for the second season (2022) at the same time as paying the entry fee. This must be paid 48 hours before the start up draft commences. 

### Yearly Dues ###

- After the first two years there is a yearly total of $50 that must be paid 2 weeks before the start of the yearly rookie draft.
- Dues must also be paid immediately for any year a team trades draft picks in. These fees will be due within 24 hours of the trade being completed. Failure to pay these dues will result in the trade being cancelled.

### Penalties ###
If a team does not pay their dues by the designated date they are not eligible to participate in the draft (startup or rookie) it will be up to the commissioners discretion on whether or not to replace them.
